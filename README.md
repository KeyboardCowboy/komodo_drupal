Komodo Drupal for Mac
================================================================================
Snippets and Macros to make Drupal coding more efficient.


+ Supported Versions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Komodo Edit 7.x
- Drupal 7.x


+ Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is on organic collection of Drupal module hooks, complete with proper
doxygen comments and function signatures.  The more I use, the more the contents
will grow.  Forking, patching and contributing is always appreciated.


+ Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the "tools" folder in your current version of Komodo Edit.
   E.x. /Users/[name]/Library/Application Support/KomodoEdit/[version]/tools

2. You should see a list of folders that resembles your Toolbox panel in Komodo
   with folders such as "Samples ([version])."  Create a new folder called
   "Drupal" and place the contents of this repo into it.

3. Restart Komodo and you should see a new folder called "Drupal" in your
   toolbox.

{Pro Tip}
- In Komodo create a new toolbar then drop this repo into that and you'll have
  your tools right in the Komodo toolbar panel at the top.
